# Annotations

## Create a Resource Controller

In Spring’s approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are identified by the @RestController annotation, and the GreetingController shown in the following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/restservice/GreetingController.java) handles GET requests for /greeting by returning a new instance of the Greeting class:

        @RestController
        public class GreetingController {

            private static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
            private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

            @GetMapping("/greeting")
            public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
                return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name));
            }
        }

This controller is concise and simple, but there is plenty going on under the hood. We break it down step by step.

The @GetMapping annotation ensures that HTTP GET requests to /greeting are mapped to the greeting() method.

There are companion annotations for other HTTP verbs (e.g. @PostMapping for POST). There is also a @RequestMapping annotation that they all derive from, and can serve as a synonym (e.g. @RequestMapping(method=GET)).
@RequestParam binds the value of the query string parameter name into the name parameter of the greeting() method. If the name parameter is absent in the request, the defaultValue of World is used.

The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new Greeting object with id and content attributes based on the next value from the counter and formats the given name by using the greeting template.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a Greeting object. The object data will be written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

This code uses Spring @RestController annotation, which marks the class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view. It is shorthand for including both @Controller and @ResponseBody.

The Greeting object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring’s HTTP message converter support, you need not do this conversion manually. Because Jackson 2 is on the classpath, Spring’s MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter is automatically chosen to convert the Greeting instance to JSON.

@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

* @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.


* @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

* @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

    com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.


# Consuming a RESTful Web Service

    @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)
    public class Quote {

    private String type;
    private Value value;

This simple Java class has a handful of properties and matching getter methods. It is annotated with @JsonIgnoreProperties from the Jackson JSON processing library to indicate that any properties not bound in this type should be ignored.

To directly bind your data to your custom types, you need to specify the variable name to be exactly the same as the key in the JSON document returned from the API. In case your variable name and key in JSON doc do not match, you can use @JsonProperty annotation to specify the exact key of the JSON document. (This example matches each variable name to a JSON key, so you do not need that annotation here.)
